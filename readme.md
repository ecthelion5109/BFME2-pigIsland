## Wave defense

# To do:
- ensure map is 600x600. scaling current(v6) would look good.
- spawn points should be outside map and we need fog of war. 
- vision must to be important for archers/catapults to shoot 
- distribute more defense expansion pads.
# Potato messages:
	1. "i need working Campsandcastle.ini
		Defense plots (smaltower/Catapults/other)
		Normal Plot (Production/Recource/UnitUpgrades)
		Special Plot "economy plot" for special bonuses (Money multply, Powerpoint Gain, ExpGain, GlobalBuff, Vision, Building Upgrades etc)"
	2. "@bumb1ðŸ¦ŒðŸ’©ðŸŸ¦ I want Upgrade my catapults and Towers with flaming Monition/Silverthorn when i have fortress upgrades.
		But just the towers and Siege towers around the fortress get the Upgrade. (With Armor upgrade it works)"
